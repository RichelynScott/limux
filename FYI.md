## 2026-05-29 - Limux Agent-Team Protocol Safety And Resume Plan
### What:
Fixed the highest-risk `agent-team` behavior by moving generated protocol output from `AGENTS.md` to `LIMUX_AGENTS.md` by default, added `--protocol-path`, and documented the next zero-friction protocol discovery phase.

### Why:
The operator workflow depends on one visible Codex session plus one Claude Code session per project, often across 4+ projects with subagents, adversarial review, and hcom cross-team communication. Generated runtime protocol files must not clobber authoritative repo instructions.

### How:
Implemented and pushed `cec067f fix(cli): protect agent-team protocol output`; then ran a five-subagent brainstorm that recommended explicit instruction-source references instead of silent inheritance or copying. Created `HANDOFF.md` and refreshed the Limux vs Multica and Limux+hcom docs for morning resumption.

### Impact:
Existing repo `AGENTS.md` files are protected from default `agent-team` protocol generation. The next safe step is to make `LIMUX_AGENTS.md` easier for agents to discover by adding generated markers, detected instruction-source pointers, no-overwrite semantics, and a local extension file.
