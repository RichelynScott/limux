Append-only journal for significant Limux session decisions and implementation notes.

## 2026-05-29 - Limux Agent-Team Protocol Safety And Resume Plan
### What:
Fixed the highest-risk `agent-team` behavior by moving generated protocol output from `AGENTS.md` to `LIMUX_AGENTS.md` by default, added `--protocol-path`, and documented the next zero-friction protocol discovery phase.

### Why:
The operator workflow depends on one visible Codex session plus one Claude Code session per project, often across 4+ projects with subagents, adversarial review, and hcom cross-team communication. Generated runtime protocol files must not clobber authoritative repo instructions.

### How:
Implemented and pushed `cec067f fix(cli): protect agent-team protocol output`; then ran a five-subagent brainstorm that recommended explicit instruction-source references instead of silent inheritance or copying. Created `HANDOFF.md` and refreshed the Limux vs Multica and Limux+hcom docs for morning resumption.

### Impact:
Existing repo `AGENTS.md` files are protected from default `agent-team` protocol generation. The next safe step is to make `LIMUX_AGENTS.md` easier for agents to discover by adding generated markers, detected instruction-source pointers, no-overwrite semantics, and a local extension file.

## 2026-05-29 - Next Steps Decision Packet
### What:
Created a dark-mode HTML decision packet for the operator to review current Limux status, next-step options, execution mode, skills, and acceptance criteria.

### Why:
The operator asked for an easier-to-read status update with selectable choices and a copy-back response before continuing implementation.

### How:
Used the `$html-decision-packet` pattern and current repo evidence from `HANDOFF.md`, `docs/cmux-parity-plan.md`, recent commits, and the install/security report. The packet defaults to the recommended path: implement Phase 5A zero-friction protocol discovery in the current session.

### Impact:
The next session can ask the operator to open `docs/LIMUX_NEXT_STEPS_STATUS_DECISION_PACKET_2026-05-29.html`, copy selections back, and proceed without reconstructing the prior discussion.
